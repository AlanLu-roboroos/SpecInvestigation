# SpecInvestigation

constants.py hold constants for all equations

plot.py plots linear air resistance, no air resistance, and files containing x, y, z, coordinates in a 3d plot

plotData.py plots x, y coordinate files in 2d

recursion.py generates x, y, z, velocity files, x, y, z, position files with a given time increment and time scale

thin.py takes a file as an input and outputs a file with a given amount of lines. Was used to thin down the 8 million line files.

getData.py takes a file and outputs a column for ease of use.

plotPolyFit.py takes a file with coefficients for a sixth degree polynomial in x, y, and z functions and plots them in 3d.
